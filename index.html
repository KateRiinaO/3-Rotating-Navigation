            <h1>Middlemist's Red camellia</h1>
            <p>Plant-lovers will have to take it on trust, as its magnificent Georgian home still has the builders in, but one of the rarest flowers in the world is in full bloom.
                The Middlemist's Red camellia has been flowering for more than two centuries within a couple of miles of its first home outside China. There are believed to be only two left in the world – the one lighting up the Duke of Devonshire's conservatory at Chiswick, west London, and another in Waitangi, New Zealand.
                The plant was collected in China in 1804 by John Middlemist, from Shepherd's Bush, west London, who gave it to Kew Gardens. It has vanished from there, but by 1823 a descendant was nearby, in the camellia collection which the sixth Duke of Devonshire housed in the 300ft-long (91-metre) conservatory he added to his great-grandfather's Palladian villa, Chiswick House.
                By the late 19th century the house was rented out to a variety of tenants and the conservatory fell into ruin. It lost its glass in the blitz, but escaped total destruction when it took a hit from a bomb which failed to explode.
                Local volunteers helped patch up the conservatory and rescue the camellias in the 1980s. It took plant scientists more than a decade to identify most of the species. Some turned out to be unique, making up one of the greatest historic camellia collections in the world: seven still evade identification.</p>
        
        <h3>The Camellia Flower Family</h3>
        <img src="https://cdn.insteading.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/50787924126_130d22f2c1_c.jpg" alt="The Camellia Flower">
        <p>Camellias are a popular plant, originally found in eastern and southern Asia, in the regions between the Himalayas and Japan, and Indonesia. Part of the Theaceae family, there are at least 300 species and more than 3,000 hybrids. Camellias were popular, both in gardens and in the wild in China and Japan, long before they appeared in European and English gardens. In fact, the first didn’t appear in an English garden until the early 18th century.
            Camellias are actually evergreen shrubs, sometimes growing into small trees up to 60 feet tall. The glossy leaves are thick and serrated, and the flowers are large, a prominent feature of the plant. These flowers can be as large as 5 inches in diameter with 5 to 9 petals. Colors include white, pink, red, and yellow (the yellow ones found in South China and Vietnam). The white-flowered variety is preferred for making tea. The dense collection of yellow stamens, a stark contrast to the petal color, is the fruit; a dry capsule, often divided into five compartments — all of which contain up to eight seeds.
            Camellias do well in humus-rich, acid soils. They don’t flourish in chalky or calcium-rich soil. Due to its size and the size of the flowers, they require a large amount of water (and don’t tolerate drought). That said, there are some species that flourish in more arid, karst soil, as is found in Vietnam.
            It is a fast-growing plant. Depending on the variety and geographical location, they usually grow about 12 inches a year until the plant is mature. Although beautiful, ornamental shrubs, it has long been grown for its various cooking, medicinal, and cosmetic properties, the most popular use being tea as a beverage and tea oil as a seasoning. It also has significant use in industrial applications. Camellia oil, made from pressed seeds, is used to clean and protect the blades of various cutting instruments.
